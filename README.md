# numtheorylib
Lightweight template library, that could do some basic operations with the number divisors.
_You can freely use and modify it._
## Basic library usage
#### Solver initialization
```C++
MNumTheory::solver<> solver;
```
#### Greatest common divisor
```C++
solver(X, Y);
```
#### Least common multiple
```C++
solver[{X, Y}];
```
#### Divisor operations
Will be added in the next update.
